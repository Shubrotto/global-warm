              Burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat is a major
              contributor to global emissions, primarily carbon dioxide and
              nitrous oxide, which are potent greenhouse gases. Over a quarter
              of global electricity comes from renewable sources like wind and
              solar, which produce minimal emissions compared to fossil fuels.

              The manufacturing and industrial sectors emit significant
              greenhouse gases, primarily from burning fossil fuels for energy.
              This includes processes for making cement, steel, electronics,
              plastics, and more. Mining and construction also contribute to
              emissions. Machinery often runs on fossil fuels, and materials
              like plastics are derived from them. Overall, manufacturing is a
              major global emitter of greenhouse gases.

              Deforestation, driven by activities like farming and logging,
              releases stored carbon dioxide as trees are cut down.
              Approximately 12 million hectares of forest are lost annually.
              Forests act as carbon sinks, so their destruction reduces nature's
              ability to absorb emissions. Deforestation, along with land use
              changes, contributes to about a quarter of global greenhouse gas
              emissions
